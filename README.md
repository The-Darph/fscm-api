# Fascism Tracker API

> A collaborative account of every significant fascist event enacted by the current U.S. administration until it either ends or it ends us...

## Purpose

The purpose of this API is to provide a backend to pull data related to these fascists acts. It serves as an archive
and a way to search, sort, and filter these things so people can get an idea of the scale and speed of what is unfolding.

## Contributing

For simplicity and security, all contributions will happen via database
seeds. You write a database seed using standard SQL statements.

### What counts as a "fascist event"
